## üî¨ Event Overview

A global event uniting researchers, data scientists, microbiologists & clinicians to tackle key challenges in **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** and **microbial bioinformatics**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **not** a training event.

- Held before the Applied Bioinformatics & Public Health Microbiology conference (Hinxton)
- Teams will prototype scalable, real-world solutions
- Focus on collaboration, transparency, and impact
- Mentorship & knowledge sharing at the core
- Make a difference in global health through innovation and teamwork

## üß† Ideas & Themes

### AMR via Metagenomics
- Predict resistance in metagenomes vs. isolates  
- Detect AMR/MGE in metagenomic reads  
- Resistance surveillance tools  
- SCCmec elements in non-*aureus* *Staphylococcus*  
- WASM-based, client-side AMR prediction tools  
- Global data sharing dashboards

### Complex Genomics
- Co-occurrence of AMR genes and genetic markers (*E. coli*)  
- Short-read mining for repeats and complex genomic events  
- Recombination-aware SNP analysis (*Legionella*)  
- mGWAS for trait associations

### Tooling & Pipelines
- Validate nanopore sequencing results  
- Standardize outputs & naming conventions  
- Out-of-the-box pipelines for GUI apps  
- Benchmark and improve AMR detection tools

### LLMs & AI
- Use existing LLMs for public health workflows  
- On-device LLMs for interpreting pipeline outputs  
- AI agents in microbial bioinformatics  
- Leverage GitPod, Google Colab, etc., for accessibility
